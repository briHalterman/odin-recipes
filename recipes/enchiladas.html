    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baked enchiladas are a comforting, flavor-packed dish made by rolling tortillas around a savory filling—typically
    shredded chicken, beef, beans, or cheese—then smothering them in a rich, seasoned sauce and melted cheese. Once
    assembled, the enchiladas are baked until the cheese is bubbly and golden and the flavors meld together beautifully.
    Whether topped with a classic red enchilada sauce or a creamy verde, they're often served with rice, beans, sour cream,
    and fresh garnishes like cilantro or avocado, making them a satisfying and crowd-pleasing meal.</p>
