    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Curry is a flavorful and aromatic dish with countless regional variations, typically made by simmering meat, vegetables,
    or legumes in a richly spiced sauce. Originating from South Asia and adapted across the globe, curry can be mild or
    fiery, creamy or tomato-based, and is often seasoned with a blend of spices like turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili.
    Whether itâ€™s a Thai green curry with coconut milk, an Indian butter chicken, or a Jamaican curry goat, the dish is known
    for its bold, warming flavors and is usually served with rice or flatbread to soak up the delicious sauce.</p>
